              <h1>The Five Sisters</h1>
              <p>
                The sisters are all physically identical with large blue eyes, light-reddish hair, cute expressive faces and shapely figures. 
                Despite their different hairstyles, the sisters are experts at impersonating each other and often do so for pranks or convenience. 
                They were born on May 5 and live together in a rich high-rise apartment and by following the "go-toubun" (five portions, divided equally) 
                philosophy given by their late mother, consider themselves five parts of one whole.
